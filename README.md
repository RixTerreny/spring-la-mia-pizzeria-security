# Pizza Management Web Application pt. 2  :pizza:

This is a sample web application to help manage a pizzeria. It allows you to view, create, update, and delete pizza records in the database. Additionally, it supports managing special offers and ingredients and this CRUD operation can be made only by an `admin` not by an `user`.
